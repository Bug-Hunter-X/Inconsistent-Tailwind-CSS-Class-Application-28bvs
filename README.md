# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Class Application

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied, resulting in unexpected styling. The problem is specifically related to a situation where certain classes fail to take effect, despite being correctly included in the HTML.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains a simple HTML structure with some Tailwind CSS classes. However, the styles defined by these classes are not applied correctly.  The text should be red and have padding, but it's displayed without the expected formatting.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows a corrected version. The solution involves carefully reviewing class names, ensuring that the Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly set up (including the `purge` option if being used), and checking for potential conflicts with other CSS rules or browser-specific issues.
